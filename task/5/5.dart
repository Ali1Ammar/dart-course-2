/* we must solve task 4 before this 
create a SumNumbers class 
that take 10 number from the user using BaseInputFromUser class from task 1
and print the sum of this numbers,
then write a main() program to use this class
create the following funciton inside the SumNumbers class to implments this logic
1- input()
use BaseInputFromUser class from task 4 to input the number from user

2- sum()
calculate the resutl and save it inside a private variable,
thorw a exception if we run sum() before taking input from the user

3- printResult()
print the result to the user
thorw a exception if we run print() before calculate the result or input the data
